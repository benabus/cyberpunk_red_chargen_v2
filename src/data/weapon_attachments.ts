        description: "Installing or uninstalling a Smartgun Link takes an hour. A weapon is a Smartgun only when it has a Smartgun Link attached to it. Special Cyberware is required to take advantage of a Smartgun. A Smartgun Link must be connected to you with Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip in order to operate, both of which require you to have a Neural Link. A Subdermal Grip connects a Smartgun held in it automatically. You can plug in Interface Plugs as part of drawing a Smartgun into a free hand, as long as your Interface Plugs aren't already plugged into something else. Being disarmed of your Smartgun doesn't snap your cables, it just unplugs them from the Smartgun. Plugging them back in isn't an Action should you have the Smartgun in your hand, as their ports are designed for ease-of-use. Why go through all this trouble? Because when making Ranged Attacks with one, you add a +1 to your Check. Requires 2 Attachment Slots.",
